Data Structures & Algorithms (C / C++ Programs)

This repository contains my collection of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms programs, implemented in C and C++. These programs represent my strong foundation in logic-building, problem-solving, and understanding how core data structures work internally.

Each file in this repository focuses on a specific concept — from loops and conditional statements to linked lists, number theory, and pattern printing.
These programs were created as part of my practice to strengthen my basics and build confidence for advanced DSA topics.

🚀 What’s Inside This Repository?
🔹 Basic Logic & Control Flow

for.cpp – Loop-based problems

else if.cpp – Conditional logic practice

first.cpp – Beginner-level C++ program structure

plus minus.cpp – Basic arithmetic operations

OddEven.cpp – Number property checking

sumOFEvenNO.cpp – Summation logic

prime.cpp – Prime number checking

🔹 Pattern Printing Programs

(Strong understanding of loops & nested loops)

pattern 1.cpp

pattern 2.cpp

pattern 3.cpp

pattern 4.cpp

pattern 5.cpp

Patterns include triangles, pyramids, number patterns, and star-based shapes — useful for improving logical thinking and nested loop mastery.

🔹 Array-Based Programs

ArrayLoop.cpp – Working with arrays, loops, and indexing

jhh.c – Additional array & logic trials

Other small array-related exercises

🔹 Linked List Implementations

(Created from scratch using pointers)

LinkedList.c

LinkedList 2.c

Covers:

Node creation

Insertion

Deletion

Traversal

Basic linked list operations manually implemented without STL

🔹 Small Functional Programs

calculator.cpp – Basic command-line calculator

Additional mini-practice codes included
